## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/testingbysaurabh/Dailer_fe.git
   cd Dailer_fe
   ```

2. **Open the app**:
   Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Open Dailer** on two different devices or tabs.
2. Note your **Calling ID** displayed on the home screen.
3. On the first device, enter the **Calling ID** of the second device.
4. Click **Call Friend**.
5. The second device will receive a notification and show an **Incoming Call** screen.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

Calls are peer-to-peer (P2P), meaning audio data travels directly between browsers and does not pass through the signaling server after the connection is established.
